Whami 1.0 baseline code for Android
=====
This is a working set of the Ionic framework-based codeset for Whami. This is intended to be the baseline for reference for 
building on for iOS and our other intended "secondary" platforms: Windows 8.1, Blackberry Z10 and Foxfire OS. Note: Ionic
is not currently supported for the secondary platforms- but we are ok with that for now- I expect the framework will be ready
when we are.

There are a number of features that we may not use- the contact feature for friends, for example. And there are a number of
new features that are not implemented.

The code is based on work done by our friends at Evontech and by our architect Kevin Wei. I just cleaned up the code by
beautifying it and by placing all the global variables in a single location atop the HomePage.js file.

In HomePage, place any variable changes that you want to consider. You should not need to make any other var changes in
any other file.
